# Graphs

* Graphs have **edges/links** and **vertices/nodes**
* Graphs are used to formally represent a network, or a collection of interconnected objects

* Mathmetical definition:

>  G = (V, E)

* V is the set of nodes in the graph
* E is a set of pairs of vertices used to define the edges

* **Singleton Graph**: a graph with only one vertex

### Types of Edges
* **directed edge**: an edge that is directional, can only traverse from A to B and not the other way around
* **undirected edge**: the path between A and B is bidirectional
