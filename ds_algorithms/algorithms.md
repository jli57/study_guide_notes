# Algorithms: Design and Analysis

* Vocabulary for design and analysis of algorithm
* Divide and conquer algorithm
* Randomization in algorithm design
* Primitives for reasoning graphs
  * Shortest Paths
* Use and implementation of data structures

## Sorting Algorithms
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort

## Guiding Principles for Analysis of Algorithms
1. Worst-case analysis
2. Ignore constant factors and lower-order terms
3. Asymptotic analysis: assume running for large inputs

Fast algorithm: worst-case running time grows slowly with input
